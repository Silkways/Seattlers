# Seattlers
Flatiron First Project

This will be our first analysis as a Data Scientist at the new department, the purpose of this analysis is part of our learning process. The insight we obtained from this first analysis would be the base to continue to explore other models until we achieved satisfactory results predicting the price of real state.

# Summary

The objective of the analysis conducted is to gain an alternative understanding of the Seattle property
market for the development of our real estate financing business. This is an experimental in-house analysis.
u The problematics addressed in the analysis will aim to complement the traditional micro level evaluation for
real estate financing.

u We are aiming to answer the following questions using regression analysis:
u Will price increase provided we keep the living surface constant and increase the grading by 1?
u Will price increase provided we increase living surface and keep the grading constant?
u How do the models compare if we proceed with the removal of outlier values in our variables?




# Conclusion

It is necessary to spend more time exploring the data and on the data clearing process as the correlations visualitations of the parameters would have improved. The parameters we have chosen to base our analysis : sqft_living and grade are not sufficient to provide a good prediction, other parameters need to be included. 
We realize location is a mayor factor in predicting the price but we have chosen not to pursue this analysis given the little experience and short time given to produce results.
